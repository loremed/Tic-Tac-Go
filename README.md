# Tic-Tac-Go

This is the project I created to learn the Go programming language.
It is an implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. I engineered the application using the OOP paradigm to make each package as a separate entity.

It is now playable only using the command line; future development includes a GUI for the application.

## Notable features:
  - play with a friend or against a CPU player
  - choose a name for each human player
  - custom sign for each player
  - play against a random CPU or the stronger Minimax implementation, your best chance will be to draw the game!

## Usage:
  - you need **GO** installed on your system
  - after downloading the code move to the ``main`` subfolder (``cd ./main``)
  - run by typing ``go run .``
  - after completing the initial configuration the game will begin
  - at the end of each game you will be asked whether you want to play again

## Future development:
  - the application runs completely in the command line; a GUI will be implemented, at least for the duration of the game. Even later, a GUI could be created for the initial configuration
